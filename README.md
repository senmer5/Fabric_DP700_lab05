# üöÄ Create and Use Dataflows (Gen2) in Microsoft Fabric

## Lab Purpose

The purpose of this lab was to understand and apply the fundamental features of **Dataflows (Gen2)** in Microsoft Fabric. Using a no-code approach via **Power Query Online**, I connected to an external CSV data source, applied data transformations, and loaded the data into a **Lakehouse**. I then used a **Data Pipeline** to orchestrate the flow. This lab provided a hands-on introduction to scalable data ingestion and transformation workflows in the cloud.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps Followed

### 1. Create a Fabric Workspace
- Logged in to [Microsoft Fabric](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/home?experience=fabric).
- Created a new workspace with trial capacity enabled.

### 2. Create a Lakehouse
- Created a new Lakehouse from the "Data Engineering" section.
- Gave it a unique and identifiable name.

### 3. Build a Dataflow (Gen2)
- Created a new **Dataflow Gen2** and opened it in Power Query Online.
- Imported data from a CSV file using the following URL:
  - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/dp-data/main/orders.csv`
- Authentication: Anonymous
- Created a custom column named `MonthNo` using the formula:
  - `Date.Month([OrderDate])`
- Verified data types:  
  - `OrderDate`: Date  
  - `MonthNo`: Whole Number

### 4. Add a Data Destination
- Connected the dataflow to the previously created **Lakehouse**.
- Specified the destination table name as `orders`.
- Chose to append data with manual settings and published the dataflow.

### 5. Integrate with a Pipeline
- Created a **Data Pipeline** named `Load data`.
- Added a **Dataflow activity** and selected the previously created dataflow.
- Saved and ran the pipeline to ingest data into the lakehouse.

### 6. Verify Results
- Refreshed the tables in the lakehouse view.
- Verified the `orders` table was created and loaded with transformed data.

### 7. Clean Up Resources
- Deleted the workspace after completion to free up resources.
